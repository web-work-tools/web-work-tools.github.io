      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s personal. It&amp;rsquo;s private. And it&amp;rsquo;s no one&amp;rsquo;s business but yours. You may be planning a political campaign, discussing your taxes, or having a secret romance. Or you may be communicating with a political dissident in a repressive country. Whatever it is, you don&amp;rsquo;t want your private electronic mail (email) or confidential documents read by anyone else. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with asserting your privacy. Privacy is as apple-pie as the Constitution.</description>

      <description>The fundamental building blocks of SEO are Keyword Research, Content, Internal linking, Site Structure, and a Multitude of Technical Optimizations.
Most of those optimizations revolve around gradually making every individual piece of code on your site more machine readable, to communicate with a variety of connecting sites/services and make it stand out from the crowd.</description>
