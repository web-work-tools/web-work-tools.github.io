      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to learn Hugo a few different ways, and finally found one that works for me, and I hope will work well for anyone.
This guide and the accompanying repository should help anyone switching from either Jekyll to Hugo, or Hugo to Jekyll.
I&amp;rsquo;ve got two branches of the same exact website except one is run by Jekyll and one is run by Hugo!!
That&amp;rsquo;s pretty neat, if you ask me!</description>

      <title>Creating a Test Branch and Merging back the Changes</title>

      <description>I made a test branch for the swapping jekyll for hugo article, and then merged the changes back to master, once I had it running.
Checkout test branch Use the command git checkout -b will allow you to create a local branch for testing.
I will call my new branch test-hugo so the command will be like so:
git checkout -b test-hugo
Some git basics for newbs like me  Git Branching and Merging  Git keeps track of all your files, but not just the files, but everything in the repository.</description>
