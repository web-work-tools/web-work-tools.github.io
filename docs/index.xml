      <description>As you can see, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy. That&amp;rsquo;s 8 different websites, all published to the same domain.
What is likly to happen, is there will be a split among domains, and eventually I&amp;rsquo;ll find some CMS that I want to publish a few of the repositories together, with.
 About Me  I know it&amp;rsquo;s better seo value to keep everything on one domain, but I intend to create a lot of content on a variety of subjects, some of which are only tangentally related.</description>

      <title>Migrating from Jekyll HPSTR to Hugo.</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to learn Hugo a few different ways, and finally found one that works for me, and I hope will work well for anyone.
This guide and the accompanying repository should help anyone switching from either Jekyll to Hugo, or Hugo to Jekyll.
I&amp;rsquo;ve got two branches of the same exact website except one is run by Jekyll and one is run by Hugo!!
That&amp;rsquo;s pretty neat, if you ask me!</description>

      <title>Creating a Test Branch and Merging back the Changes</title>

      <description>I made a test branch for the swapping jekyll for hugo article, and then merged the changes back to master, once I had it running.
Checkout test branch Use the command git checkout -b will allow you to create a local branch for testing.
I will call my new branch test-hugo so the command will be like so:
git checkout -b test-hugo
Some git basics for newbs like me  Git Branching and Merging  Git keeps track of all your files, but not just the files, but everything in the repository.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some tools to make content creation a little easier.

      <description>I learned of this cool project from @bmann. I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting a simple way to make a page like this for a while!
It&amp;rsquo;s really nice to have a place to keep track, because I&amp;rsquo;m always forgetting how many I even manage!
It might seem intimidating to hear, &amp;ldquo;Just Fork It!&amp;rdquo;
However, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it&amp;rsquo;s not much more complex than that.
Step 1 Fork this repository:

      <description>Note: This is just a &amp;ldquo;stub&amp;rdquo;, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t go fully into the details of keyword research. I have written an article on the subject, and begun some study of Keyword Research and SEO, although I&amp;rsquo;m not by any means an expert.
I made this, because it was a little confusing for me when I first tried to use it, and I wanted to be sure that eveyone in my organization had a fundamental understanding of keyword research, so they could assist in coming up with seed-keywords, and understand the building blocks of keyword-research.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve gradually eliminated all of my clients from the time where I was primarily creating content for hire. As I learn more publishing skills, I can see that there is more value in that type of work.
I&amp;rsquo;d be more interested to write for you if you want me to set up your website. Regardless, I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to consider any offers.
Research Consulting In-depth research is time-consuming. In crypto, the matter is made even more challenging because of the vast amount of domain knowledge required to obtain quality results.</description>

      <description>You may have noticed that the GitHub Pages Starter Pack is getting a bit crowded.
Well, now i&amp;rsquo;m looking into options besides jekyll, to expand my skills, and try out some themes that aren&amp;rsquo;t available for Jekyll.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, if you are new like me, getting jekyll themes to work is tricky. Many of them are not supported anymore.
What is a Static Site Generator (SSG)? There are some configuration files, layouts and templates, and then there is all your content that your create.</description>

      <description>This blog is where I document my journey as an independent web-worker, and will grow to include contributions from other independent workers of the web.
This page has some samples of content that I&amp;rsquo;ve created for others, as well as general resources for web-work.
Originally it wasn&amp;rsquo;t in blog form&amp;hellip; but I just looked on github, to see when I started, and chose the date that way, for each. This page wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the blog, either.</description>

      <description>Github makes it easy to get started, with the click of a button, you can have a web-page live, requiring only markdown skills (that anyone can learn on the go).
Each feature you want to enable requires a little more learning, and GitHub Pages is set up so that if you decide to, you can gradually progress from content creator to web-developer.
If you don’t want to think about web-development, and simply want your markdown files to look beautiful once published, github pages can help you do that too.</description>

      <description>SEO seems like a valuable subject to know about right?
The problem with SEO is that there&amp;rsquo;s so much to learn, it&amp;rsquo;s a vast domain of knowledge, with many branches that could each take up thier own websites of related information.
SEO is always changing, and a lot of incorrect or outdated information is republished.
What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do is break it down into it&amp;rsquo;s various components.
The fundamental building blocks of SEO are:</description>
