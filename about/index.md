As you can see, I've been busy. That's 8 different websites, all published to the same domain.

What is likly to happen, is there will be a split among domains, and eventually I'll find some CMS that I want to publish a few of the repositories together, with.

* [About Me](https://infominer.id/about)

I know it's better seo value to keep everything on one domain, but I intend to create a lot of content on a variety of subjects, some of which are only tangentally related.

But you can see, eventually this will be 5 domains with infominer.id becoming the home page for all of it, webwork.tools, didecentral.com, SourceCrypto (don't remember if I have one for that), learncryptotrading.co.

I should probably hoook each of those domains up with a re-direct right now... I've just been pre-occupied with other things. That way I could still gain some promotional benefit of using the domain, while retaining the SEO value of having them live together for the time being.

WebWork will be a mix of traditional web-technologies, and practical application of new web-tech such as ipfs and blockchain. It's also where any practical data-science experiments would live.

Ok, thanks for having this chat with me!

## Web Work

## Decentralized Identity

* [DIDecentralized](https://infominer.id/DIDecentralized)

I already have purchased DIDecentral.com, but for now, the SEO value is better to keep tied to infominer.id.

## Source Crypto
* [InfoMine](https://infominer.id)
* [Source Crypto](https://infominer.id/SourceCrypto)
