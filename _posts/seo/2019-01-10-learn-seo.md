The problem with SEO is that there's so much to learn. It's a vast domain of knowledge, with many branches that could each take up thier own websites of related information.

SEO is always changing, incorrect and\or outdated information is often republished.

## Before you worry about SEO

I haven't learned to finer points of SEO, because they are irrelevant to me. First, I intend to gain mastery of JAMStack publishing, and lay a proper foundation for my journey. 

Until then, I've focused on creating curated lists, which I find infinitely more valuable than writing articles devoid of substance, before I know what to write about.

It's my intention to break SEO down to it's essential components, and gather links here, while learning. The following sections are arranged with fundamentals at the start, and more comprehensive information towards the end.


## Fundamental Building Blocks

* Content 
* Internal linking and Site Structure
* Keyword Reserach
* A Multitude of Technical Optimizations

Many of those optimizations revolve around gradually making every individual piece of code on your site more machine readable, so it communicates essential bits of information that make it stand out from the crowd.

## E-A-T

A lot of noise is made about [E-A-T](https://moz.com/blog/google-e-a-t), ever since google changed it's algorithm, in 2018. 

<center>Expertise, Authority, and Trustworthiness</center>

Of course, these are valuable qualities to have if you wish for your site to rise through the ranks. But what if you're just starting out, and you don't have any of that? No optimization is going to solve that for you. Those qualities must be earned.

## Know Your Self-Customer-Competition

Personally, I'm content first. I don't have a specific product I'd like to sell, or concrete business model. I began by creating content in the freelance markets, and learning what my clients are interested in. 

While our interests don't *always* align, I'm able to determine which type of clients I'm most interested in working with. I also learn how the market is interested to use my services, since I've often been asked to work outside of my preferred domain. 

In an iterative process, I've explored various areas of interest, and am beginning to see a path forward.

If you already have a product you should begin by investigating who your competition is. You'll want to find sucessful individuals or businesses in your field, and determine what's working for them. Then you can work on envisioning your customer in some detail, and creating content specifically targeted towards them.

## What is High-Quality Content?

Some sites are able to rise in the search rankings without offering value, relying on backlink spam and hacky optimizations. But why tho? To sell a product? Even having premium search placement, there must be something to set you apart from the crowd. 

If you have worthwhile content, people will visit regardless of whether they're interested in you or your business. Then your site will be more attractive to do business with.

So the idea is to provide a ton of value, and from there you can learn how to engage with your visitors. Once you've built up a base of visitors, you can begin learning their needs. You might discover markets that you weren't intending to target, then you can create content and place offers specifically for them.

>* Guest Blogging
>* "opinion-forming journalism from recognized experts, and data-driven research studies showed a strong correlation between shares and links."
>* Client case studies: These are shared by the client and can include exciting information about how they achieved their results, which can help others.
>* Infographics: These still get shared heavily online and are a great way to provide an instant view of data on a specific topic. It can be fun and informative, and usually, are republished on other blogs and shared on social media.
>* Other content that highlights influencers: This could include podcasts or video interviews.
>* Industry surveys: Many publishers do annual industry surveys, which have become well-known (and well-cited) each time they are released. 
>* Free content or tools: This could include long-form content such as ebooks, or useful tools like quizzes and personalized reports that give users the helpful information they didn’t know before. -[What to do when things go wrong](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-guide/what-to-do-when-things-go-wrong/)
  
### Evergreen Content

The general idea is that your content should be useful. It's really not rocket science.

There are a few models for content creation I've appreciated discovering. Evergreen content is the first of these, and perhaps offers the most fundamental principles of content creation. 

The idea that if you are going to do all the work to create content, you should make its value extend for as long as possible. Evergreen content is not usually found by chasing headlines (unless you intend to chase them thru the decades and present their overarching story). You want to write about something that will still be worthwhile years down the road.

Even if your presentation isn't polished, you can excel by creating information dense content not easily found elsewhere.

Usually I'm trying to learn something, and I have search dilligently across many websites to learn it, that's how I choose which topics I publish on. Create the content *you* need. That's a really good place to start.

* [5 Ideas for Creating Killer Evergreen Content [+ Examples]](https://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/creating-evergreen-content)

### Skyscraper Content

One of the fastest ways to gain expertise and authority are to create Skyscraper content! The essence is to create something incredibly more informative and expansive than currently available for your subject.

This is my #1 technique now, and partly what inspired me to focus on curated lists.  This technique works on its own, and in conjunction with any of the other techniques you'll use.

Evergreen content is a similar meme, along with 10x content. If you create truely valuable content that people need, then the SEO just isn't as important. People will link to it without asking, and visitors from google will stay on the page longer, causing you to rise up the rankings.
