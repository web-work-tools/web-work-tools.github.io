I've found myself repeating, and having a hard time remembering all of the steps when setting up ubuntu. Over the past 3 years, I started with Mint, as a daily driver, and have moved on to Ubuntu 19.04, and 18.04 LTS.

This is now where I'll be keeping track of this info. Over time, I'll organize this better, and add some notes for context, and mean to walk through the first steps of a few different setups.


At the moment, this is just a loosely organized collection of links I found useful, and leads for further exploration.

## Setup

[Is Ubuntu 19.04 worth upgrading to from 18.04 LTS? - Quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-Ubuntu-19-04-worth-upgrading-to-from-18-04-LTS)

Thanks for the A2A. No, it’s not. And it’s not recommended either. First of all, Ubuntu likes to play around a lot. For example, 18.10 uses Wayland. Also, Ubuntu likes to delete your manually installed packages upon upgrade (see my other answers f...

### Boot Loaders and Partition Tables

Basically all new systems use UEFI. However, if you are shopping for old laptops, or simply installing linux on some old windows machine you have laying around, then you might run into the legacy setup. The deal is how they are partitioned, MBR vs GPT, and can depend upon your BIOS. So it matters to figure out from the beginning what your system requirements are.

Actually, when I first installed linux, I just hit the install button, and the installer did its magic. It was only later, I puzzled for quite some time over this matter, when trying to "properly" set up a fresh system, not just letting the installer do all the work.

This page provides information about installing and booting Ubuntu using UEFI, as well as about switching between UEFI mode and legacy BIOS mode using Ubuntu.

By default, the configuration file in /etc/systemd/ contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. This file can be edited to create local overrides.

### Accounts and Permissions

I was having a bit of trouble understanding how to properly set up and operate a user alongside and admin acct

I guess the idea is that the administrator account is the first created automatically (in ubuntu) then create a user account. Although the default administrator requires password for sudo, since 'root' is actually abstracted from the ui. Though not actually root, that administrator does, have generally elevated privs otherwise. So by making a user account, you have an additional layer of security, should some application get loose, it doesn't inherit any administrator privliges from you 

but......... to use sudo from the user account 

you must either su administrator or add the user account to your list of sudoers

and if you break sudo by messing up /etc/sudoers then you can use pkexec as an alternative to sudo to fix it

* [LinuxFilesystemTreeOverview](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxFilesystemTreeOverview)
  * `/bin` is a place for most commonly used terminal commands, like ls, mount, rm, etc.
  * `/boot` contains files needed to start up the system, including the Linux kernel, a RAM disk image and bootloader configuration files. 
  * `/dev`  contains all device files, which are not regular files but instead refer to various hardware devices on the system, including hard drives.
  * `/etc`  contains system-global configuration files, which affect the system's behavior for all users.
  * `/home` home sweet home, this is the place for users' home directories.
  * `/lib`  contains very important dynamic libraries and kernel modules `/media` is intended as a mount point for external devices, such as hard drives or removable media (floppies, CDs, DVDs). 
  * `/mnt`  is also a place for mount points, but dedicated specifically to "temporarily mounted" devices, such as network filesystems.
  * `/opt`  can be used to store additional software for your system, which is not handled by the package manager.
  * `/proc` is a virtual filesystem that provides a mechanism for kernel to send information to processes. 
  * `/root` is the superuser's home directory, not in `/home/` to allow for booting the system even if `/home/` is not available.
  * `/run`  is a tmpfs (temporary file system) available early in the boot process where ephemeral run-time data is stored. Files under this directory are removed or truncated at the beginning of the boot process. (It deprecates various legacy locations such as `/var/run`, `/var/lock`, `/lib/init/rw` in otherwise non-ephemeral directory trees as well as `/dev/.  *` and `/dev/shm` which are not device files.)
  * `/sbin` contains important administrative commands that should generally only be employed by the superuser.
  * `/srv`  can contain data directories of services such as HTTP (`/srv/www/`) or FTP.
  * `/sys`  is a virtual filesystem that can be accessed to set or obtain information about the kernel's view of the system.
  * `/tmp`  is a place for temporary files used by applications.
  * `/usr`  contains the majority of user utilities and applications, and partly replicates the root directory structure, containing for instance, among others, `/usr/bin/` and `/usr/lib`.
  * `/var`  is dedicated to variable data, such as logs, databases, websites, and temporary spool (e-mail etc.) files that persist from one boot to the next. A notable directory it contains is /var/log where system log files are kept.
