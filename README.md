# [Webwork.tools](https://web-work.tools)

This is where I keep track of tools, and various resources, so I don't have to remember everything :P 

It's also a practical documentation of my journey as an independent web-worker.

I've been aiming to learn 'all the things' without formal education, and create an accompanying set of curated lists and guides, so I don't have to remember all of the fine points.

Giving [Feeling Responsive](https://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/) a try, as my jamstack skills need a stretch.
