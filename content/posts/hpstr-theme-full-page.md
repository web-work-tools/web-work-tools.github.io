  I've tried to learn Hugo a few different ways, and finally found one that works for me, and I hope will work well for anyone.

  This guide and the accompanying repository should help anyone switching from either Jekyll to Hugo, *or* Hugo to Jekyll.

Since I changed the theme too quickly for anyone to really see what it looked like, I've been saving images of how it used to look.

The whole point was not to just have the same theme, but to be able to try out many Hugo themes...

Though I really did like the HPSTR theme, I might switch back to the jekyll version even :)
