SEO seems like a valuable subject to know about right?

The problem with SEO is that there's so much to learn, it's a vast domain of knowledge, with many branches that could each take up thier own websites of related information.

SEO is always changing, and a lot of incorrect or outdated information is republished.

What I'm trying to do is break it down into it's various components.

The fundamental building blocks of SEO are:

* Keyword Reserach
* Content 
* Internal linking and Site Structure
* A Multitude of Technical Optimizations.

Most of those optimizations revolve around gradually making every individual piece of code on your site more machine readable, so that it communicates essential bits of information to a variety of connecting sites\services that make it stand out from the crowd.

## Before you worry about SEO

Mind you... none of this matters as much as having the highest quality content, if you'd like to show up (and\or remain) in the search rankings.

It's better to start with a good foundation...

You should have at least 4 pages of 1500+ word information dense content. Find a subject you are excited about that your target market is interested in, and do some research.

You'll likely find many valuable links, but nothing that presents all of the information you need in one place.

If you're working on a well-researched and indexed subject, fine tune to a particular aspect that isn't well indexed, but is particularly useful or interesting to you.

Point being, the internet is abundant with information that isn't well organized amongst eachother. Provide value, it's just work... not really hard.

Theeeeeeen you can start to think about your site structure and all of the details. If you have really informational content, there are going to be quite a few keywords, naturally... 

I haven't done any seo, besides making sure image\description pops up in social media, and my site is getting organic search traffic and rising through the rankings, relatively quickly.

Granted, I put out a ton of content.. and truthfully there are a lot of things I take for granted, like naming images with a likely key-phrases.
