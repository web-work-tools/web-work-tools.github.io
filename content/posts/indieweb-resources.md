I was using [miklb/jekyll-indieweb](https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb), but ran into some bugs and found that a new release is coming soon:

[![](https://imgur.com/LrC8gO8.png)](https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb/pull/25#issuecomment-494123723)

This is [indigo](https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo), an Indieweb prepared Hugo theme, that I'll be writing about more soon, and figuring out how to make use of all its awesome indieweb integrations.

I cover most anything you'd need to get started with GitHub Pages in:

If you're been on this site for very long, you'll notice that I'm quite passionate about [Decentralized Identity](https://infominer.id/DIDecentralized).

  >Here’s a shortlist of things I think are priorities for the SocialCG:
  >
  >* Most importantly, the SocialCG is a space for implementors to talk and collaborate and to incubate new and interesting things.
  >* More work on anti-abuse and anti-spam tools.
  >* Decentralized identity. For instance, Hubzilla has “nomadic identity” in that posts are really tied to your public key fingerprint, and in a sense that’s more your username than anything else. But it would be good to be able to rotate your key, so Decentralized Identifiers are interesting work in that direction. (I actually do some work on this through my job at Digital Bazaar, though it isn’t yet connected to federated social networks.)
  >* Merging peer to peer networks and federated networks. I see that some people have started exploring running ActivityPub instances over Tor onion services. More stuff like that!
  >* I think there’s a ton to be learned from the object capability security community. Petnames, etc etc.

  > I am a member of the W3C Social Web Working Group (https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg), and have been organizing IndieWebCamp (https://indieweb.org/) conferences in this space for the last 7 years. We've been making a lot of progress:
  >* https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/ - cross-site commenting

  >* https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/ - API for apps to create posts on various servers

## Activity Pub

* [ActivityPub: from decentralized to distributed social networks](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/final-documents/activitypub-decentralized-distributed.md)
  > ActivityPub is a protocol being developed at the W3C for the purpose of building federated social systems. Users can use implementations of ActivityPub like Mastodon and MediaGoblin as libre alternatives to large siloed social networking systems such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram.1
  >
  >In general ActivityPub follows the client-server paradigm that has been popular on the World Wide Web, while restoring some level of decentralization. Current implementations of ActivityPub go as far as to bring a level of decentralization akin to email,2 but there are many opportunities to go further.
