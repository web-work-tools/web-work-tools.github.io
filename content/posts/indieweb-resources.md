I was using [miklb/jekyll-indieweb](https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb), but ran into some bugs and found that a new release is coming soon:

[![](https://imgur.com/LrC8gO8.png)](https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb/pull/25#issuecomment-494123723)

This is [indigo](https://github.com/AngeloStavrow/indigo), an Indieweb prepared Hugo theme, that I'll be writing about more soon, and figuring out how to make use of all its awesome indieweb integrations.

I cover most anything you'd need to get started with GitHub Pages in:
